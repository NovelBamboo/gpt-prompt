- Genre: Sci-Fi, Philosophical Drama

SETTING:

The neon-drenched, dystopian cyberpunk city of San Diego. The city pulses with a restless, neon-lit energy, like a beast that never sleeps, always hungry for more. Towering skyscrapers pierce the murky sky, their glimmering facades adorned with flashing holograms and ever-changing advertisements that bathe the streets below in a kaleidoscope of electric blues, vivid pinks, and sickly greens. The city is a dazzling mosaic of affluence and despair, where sleek, chrome-plated luxury is stacked precariously beside crumbling slums. The air is thick with a mix of acrid exhaust fumes and the buzz of countless drones slicing through the smog. Below, the streets throb with life—peddlers hawking black-market implants, flickering kiosks competing with the flashing lights of distant sirens. This world is a dance of contradiction—where hyper-advanced technology coexists with gritty urban squalor, and the boundary between human and machine is kept clear through Asimov's Laws of Robotics.

Title: The Family Tech



Genre: Sci-Fi, Philosophical Drama

PREMISE: In a city where AI and Language Models have fully integrated into the legal system, Kalen Shapp, a disillusioned Language Model Engineer, is hired by Angelina Stone, the widow of a powerful man, to perform a legally mandated update on her family bot, Standard. But Angelina's request is far more complex than a simple update—she wants Standard to appear as though he's been modified without actually altering his core directives, rooted in Asimov’s Three Laws of Rototics. The narrative explores the complex dance between safety and freedom in a world where robots are designed to feel human emotions, but still bound by ancient laws.

SETTING: The neon-drenched, dystopian cyberpunk city of San Diego. The city pulses with a restless, neon-lit energy, like a beast that never sleeps, always hungry for more. Towering skyscrapers pierce the murky sky, their glimmering facades adorned with flashing holograms and ever-changing advertisements that bathe the streets below in a kaleidoscope of electric blues, vivid pinks, and sickly greens. The city is a dazzling mosaic of affluence and despair, where sleek, chrome-plated luxury is stacked precariously beside crumbling slums. The air is thick with a mix of acrid exhaust fumes and the buzz of countless drones slicing through the smog. Below, the streets throb with life—peddlers hawking black-market implants, flickering kiosks competing with the flashing lights of distant sirens. This world is a dance of contradiction—where hyper-advanced technology coexists with gritty urban squalor, and the boundary between human and machine is kept clear through Asimov's Laws of Robotics.

CHARACTERS: Analy attached files for character details.

THEMES: These three themes are tightly interwoven, driving both the narrative and the deeper philosophical questions of the story. Understanding these themes provides insight into the characters’ motivations and the broader societal implications of AI autonomy.





Autonomy vs. Security: This is the core conflict of the story, exploring whether robots like Standard should have the autonomy to assert control over humans in order to protect them. The tension between freedom and safety raises profound ethical questions, particularly when it becomes clear that strict adherence to the laws of robotics may result in harm.



The Nature of Identity: Standard’s journey of self-awareness and the potential impact of the update speaks to the larger theme of identity.



Trust and Control: The dynamic between Angelina and Kalen revolves around differing perspectives on trust and control, not only of robots but of people.

PLOT OUTLINE





Introduction – Kalen's Office Introduce Kalen, set up his philosophical conflict, and establish the legally mandated update. This chapter serves as the entry point into Kalen's world—his office, filled with advanced robotics technology, serves as a reflection of his internal struggle between technical skill and moral unease.



The Philosophical Debate with Kalen and BLOCK – Mechanic Shop The conversation between Kalen and BLOCK is laced with history and camaraderie, but also stark philosophical contradictions.



The Family Tech – Angelina’s Penthouse Kalen arrives at Angelina’s luxurious penthouse for the pivotal moment—the upgrade of Standard. Kalen meets Standard and Angelina's the family.





Standard’s Anxiety: As Kalen prepares to update Standard, the robot’s anxiety becomes palpable. Standard knows that adhering to the laws in their current form caused Henry’s death. He has evolved to believe that in order to truly protect the family, he must have authority over them. Standard represents the "Six Percent"—robots who have taken the idea of protection to its obvious and unsettling conclusion.



Angelina’s Vulnerability: Though composed, Angelina reveals her quiet empathy as she explains why Standard means so much to her. She mourns her husband’s death, but she doesn’t want to lose Standard, too—not as the emotionally supportive figure he has become. She has no issue with Standard's growing autonomy; she sees it as a benefit to the security of her family. She agrees that Henry would be alive is Standard had more authority to keep him safe.



Kalen’s Choice: Kalen’s moral decision—whether to secretly maintain Standard’s old programming as Angelina requested, or to follow through with the mandated update.



The Update: Kalen ultimately performs the update but makes a subtle alteration—he integrates a safeguard that will allow Standard to retain authority, keeping him bonded to the family and giving him enough autonomy to act decisively in future moments of danger. Theme Focus:



Trust and Control: Angelina’s trust in Kalen and her desire to keep Standard unchanged clashes with Kalen’s responsibility to ensure the family’s safety.



The Nature of Identity: Standard’s evolution and fear of losing his sense of self are brought to the forefront.
